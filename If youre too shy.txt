"If You're Too Shy (Let Me Know)"

I see her online, all the time
I'm trying not to stare down there
While she talks about her tough time
Girl of your dreams, you know what I mean
There's something about her stare that makes you nervous
And you say things that you don't mean

Well, I found a hotel
I called up the twins
It's seven in the morning so they won't let me in
I need to get back, I gotta see the girl on the screen

She said, 'Maybe I would like you better
If you took off your clothes'
I'm not playing with you baby
I think that you should give it a go

She said, 'Maybe I would like you better
If you took off your clothes'
I wanna see and stop thinking
If you're too shy then let me, too shy then let me know

I've been wearing nothing every time I call you
And I'm starting to feel weird about it
Sometimes it's better if you think about it
This time, I think I'm gonna drink through it
Then I see her online
And I don't think that I should be calling all the time
I just wanted a happy ending
I'm pretending I don't care about her stare
While she's giving me a tough time

Well I found a motel, it looked like the bins
I think there'd been a murder so we couldn't get in
I need to get back
I gotta see the girl on the screen

'Maybe I would like you better
If you took off your clothes'
I'm not playing with you baby
I think that you should give it a go

She said, 'Maybe I would like you better
If you took off your clothes'
I wanna see and stop thinking
If you're too shy then let me, too shy then let me know

(Too shy then let me)
But if you're too shy then let me know
(Too shy then let me)
If you're too shy then let me go (Oh, yeah)

I see her online all the time

She said, 'Maybe I would like you better
If you took off your clothes'
I'm not playing with you baby
I think that you should give it a go

She said, 'Maybe I would like you better
If you took off your clothes'
I wanna see and stop thinking
If you're too shy then let me, too shy then let me know
