"If You're Too Shy (Let Me Know)"

I see her online, all the time
I'm trying not to stare down there
While she talks about her tough time
Girl of your dreams, you know what I mean
There's something about her stare that makes you nervous
And you say things that you don't mean

Well, I found a hotel
I called up the twins
It's seven in the morning so they won't let me in
I need to get back, I gotta see the girl on the screen

She said, 'Maybe I would like you better
If you took off your clothes'
I'm not playing with you baby
I think that you should give it a go

She said, 'Maybe I would like you better
If you took off your clothes'
I wanna see and stop thinking
If you're too shy then let me, too shy then let me know

I've been wearing nothing every time I call you
And I'm starting to feel weird about it
Sometimes it's better if you think about it
This time, I think I'm gonna drink through it
Then I see her online
And I don't think that I should be calling all the time
I just wanted a happy ending
I'm pretending I don't care about her stare
While she's giving me a tough time

Well I found a motel, it looked like the bins
I think there'd been a murder so we couldn't get in
I need to get back
I gotta see the girl on the screen

'Maybe I would like you better
If you took off your clothes'
I'm not playing with you baby
I think that you should give it a go

She said, 'Maybe I would like you better
If you took off your clothes'
I wanna see and stop thinking
If you're too shy then let me, too shy then let me know

(Too shy then let me)
But if you're too shy then let me know
(Too shy then let me)
If you're too shy then let me go (Oh, yeah)

I see her online all the time

She said, 'Maybe I would like you better
If you took off your clothes'
I'm not playing with you baby
I think that you should give it a go

She said, 'Maybe I would like you better
If you took off your clothes'
I wanna see and stop thinking
If you're too shy then let me, too shy then let me know

"Tonight (I Wish I Was Your Boy)"

I tell you I can visualise it all
Too real it all seems
But once again, runnin' away with me
Once again, runnin' away with meThis couldn't be a dream
Runnin' away with me
Runnin' away with me

And I stop myself for a minute, see if my heart's still in it
Say a few things just to win it, funny how it works out, innit?

And I told her, "Some things have their time
How can I be yours if you're not mine?"
She said, "They should take this pain
And give it a name"

Tonight, I wish I was your boy, I
(Run away from me, run away from me)
(Run away from me, run away from me)
Tonight, I think I fucked it royally
(Run away from me, run away from me)
(Run away from me, run away from me)

Give yourself a new name
Change your voice on the train
Have her complain about your fame
Tell me that it's all a rigged game

And she told me, "Some things just take time
How can you be sure if you won't try?"
She said, "I guess I'll take this pain
Instead of your name"

Tonight, I wish I was your boy, I
(Run away from me, run away from me)
(Run away from me, run away from me)
Tonight, I think I fucked it royally
(Run away from me, run away from me)
(Run away from me, run away from me)

And it's been playing on my mind
Unfortunately, I've been to this place in my life far too many times
Sunday's nearly over so I'll just lie awake
Tonight, I wish I was your boy, I
Tonight, I think I fucked it royally

And tonight, I wish I was your boy, I
(Run away from me, run away from me)
(Run away from me, run away from me)
Tonight, I think I fucked it royally
(Run away from me, run away from me)
(Run away from me, run away from me)


"Playing On My Mind"

Will I live and die in a band?
My consciousness controls my hand
She can't swim very well
(No, but you wouldn’t be able to tell)
Let's find something to watch, then watch our phones for half the time
When we go for food, you have yours and I'll have mine
It says, "Don’t take these pills if you've been drinking any wine"
Oh, these things, they have been playing on my mind
These things, they have been playing on my mind

I think I've seen the side of every road
They all lead somewhere, I've been told
Will I get divorced when I'm old?
(Oh, why am I always cold?)
And I met one of your friends, and it was dead nice
He was fine, but he said
"Things that interest me exist outside of space and time"
Now, I know I should've left it, but who says that? What a sigh
It all kicked off and it's been playing on my mind
The whole thing has been playing on my mind

I think it's strange that I still call you
When I’ve got nothing to say
The truth is that I still adore you
And nothing really matters anyway
But I won’t get clothes online 'cause I get worried about the fit
But that rule don’t apply concerning my relationships
See, I keep getting this stuff wrong, take me out, put me on
Oh, these things, they have been playing on my mind
The whole thing has been playing on my mind
Oh, it's all been just playing on my mind
